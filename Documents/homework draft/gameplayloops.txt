Primary loop:
	-manipulate gravity to move things(objects dead and living)
	-don't die

Secondary loop:
	-reach end of each stage
	-collect all keys/solve the riddle

Tertiary loop:
	-escape the maze(win all stages and get all keys)
	-get highscore(best time for each level/all levels)
	
Motivation:
	-story
		(portal like) Olaf wakes up in maze, no memory of what happened and 			somehow unable to move and tries to escape
